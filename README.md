Cowin bot

after cloning the repo(make sure youre on develop branch :D ) add your pincode(s) (if more than one pincode,
seperate them by spaces) in the application.yml file under resources/

you can also set other configurations in the application.yml like the bot timeout, (the time in seconds after which
it will check for updates)

if the slot is found for any of the pincodes, the updates will stop, and the tone will be played :3
